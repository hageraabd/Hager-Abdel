# Hi there

I’m an IT & cloud student who learns by building things and pulling them apart until they make sense.

Right now, I’m focused on networking, Linux, and cloud fundamentals. I enjoy hands-on projects, home lab experiments, and documenting what I learn as I go.
You’ll find small projects, notes, and experiments here as I grow into a full IT role. I care more about understanding systems than pretending I already know everything.

Still learning. Still building. Still showing up.
